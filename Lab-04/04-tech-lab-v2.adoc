= Tech lab 04 (version 2)

In the previous version of this lab, multiple full pipelines were set up, one per team.

In this version of the lab, each student has their own development and production environments, flowing through a centralized development pipeline. In this way, each student gets a fuller experience.

This lab is a work in progress.

== Adapting manosXX to be one of many

=== Change the Vagrantfile
These instructions assume comprehensive familiarity with Unix commands and operations. Literal instructions are limited.

`ssh -XC` into the server.

`su` to the public1 ID; password given in class.

`cd ~\VMs` to the ~/VMs directory

`mkdir XX` where XX is the 2-digit number you have been assigned.

* Copy `~/Calavera/lab-04-Vagrantfile` to the directory you just created, giving it the name `Vagrantfile`.

* `nano` ~/VMs/XX/Vagrantfile and do the following:
** Search replace on the manosXX name (from manos02 to manosXX)
** Change the ports
*** guest: 22, host: 2120 + your #
*** guest: 80, host: 8120 + your #
*** guest: 8080, host: 9120 + your #

** Search replace on the caraXX name
** Change the ports
*** guest: 22, host: 2160 + your #
*** guest: 80, host: 8160 + your #
*** guest: 8080, host: 9160 + your #

=== Connect your server with cerebro1 (git origin)

In this section you will bring up and log into your server, then from there access cerebro1 and configure your origin git repo, then connect your server's remote to that origin.

`vagrant up manosXX` where XX = the number you have been given

`vagrant ssh manoxXX`
`cd /home/hijo`

`ssh cerebro1`

"yes" to the ECDSA prompt if it appears.

`sudo git init --bare --shared=group /home/hijoXX.git`

Why are we using git init --bare? Look it up.

 sudo chown -R git /home/hijoXX.git/
 sudo chgrp -R git /home/hijoXX.git/
 sudo cp /home/cerebro1/cookbooks/cerebro/files/post-receive /home/hijoXX.git/hooks/
 sudo chown git /home/hijoXX.git/hooks/post-receive
 sudo chmod 775 /home/hijoXX.git/hooks/post-receive
 sudo nano /home/hijoXX.git/hooks/post-receive

change XX in the below to your #, or add it if not there

  curl http://hombros1:8080/git/notifyCommit?url=git@cerebro1:/home/hijoXX.git

 exit

* you should now be back to manosXX
** initialize remote

 cd /home/hijo     # just to be sure
 ssh-keyscan cerebro1 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
 git remote add origin ssh://cerebro1/home/hijoXX.git
 exit

You should now be logged in as "public1"

 exit

You now should be logged in as yourself.

=== Configure Jenkins

 firefox -x -no-remote

go to http://127.0.0.1:9113

New Item

Freestyle

* Project name hijoXX
* Restrict where it can be run
* Label brazos1
* Source code management "Git"
* Repository URL ssh://jenkins@cerebro1/home/hijoXX.git
* Credentials|add

image::jenkins-ssh.png[]

* Branch Specifier: */master
* Poll SCM
* Generic Artifactory Integration
* Artifactory deployment server: http://espina1:8081/artifactory
* Target repository: ext-release-local (click Refresh Repositories)
* Published Artifacts:

**/target/*.jar=>hijoXX

**/target/web.xml=>hijoXX

* Capture and publish build info

* Build:
** Add build step
** Invoke Ant
** Targets: init compile test compress

* Save

* Close Firefox (to save load on server)

=== Kick off pipeline

* Back to command line (log into seis664 again if needed)

* su public1

* cd ~/VMs/XX

* vagrant ssh manos03

From this point, I am not going to give you as many explicit commands.

Navigate to the /home/hijo directory. You can run `sudo ant` to make sure ant and Tomcat are running.

Now, let's push your local repo to cerebro.

 git push origin --mirror

Now, you should open a NEW terminal session, X-windows enabled, and go back into Jenkins. Also You can open a new tab in FireFox and go to http://127.0.0.1:7112/artifactory, login is "admin/password." Go to the Artifacts tab and open ext-release-local. Observe that you do not yet have a directory there.

On your manos instance, from /home/hijo, make a small change to  src/main/java/biz/calavera/MainServlet.java, just the message regarding the "skeleton application." You can change any words/letters within that string.

Then, after you've made the change, go:

 git add . -A
 git commit "my first commit"
 git push origin master

If all is well you should see something *like*:

....
[master 5de8bfc] my first commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
vagrant@manos03:/home/hijo$ git push origin master

   2c5e543..5de8bfc  master -> master
....

Refresh Artifactory. You should see that you have a directory. This is your production-ready package!

=== Initialize CaraXX

This is deliberately challenging. Support each other on Slack.

In short, you need to create your own deployment recipe caraXX based on cara02.rb in /var/SEIS660/public1/Calavera/cookbooks/cara/recipes/. When we are done, that directory will have multiple caraXX.rb files.

* Update your Vagrantfile accordingly.

* vagrant up and test your application

== Use the pipeline

Make a change to your application and push it all the way through the pipeline. Post a screenshot to Slack of either Firefox or a curl invocation.
